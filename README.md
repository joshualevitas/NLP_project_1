# Josh's and Komal's Project
Golden Globe Project Master

What we need:

- A paramaterizable script for the event (roles, subevents, event tracking)
- Methods for identifying relevant tweets to specific actions / roles in the script (keywords, hashtags, regular expressions, phrasal patterns, variables in tree structured syntactic templates)
- Methods for extracting and aggregating information from those tweets to parameterize the script


Award Ceremonies
- Announcement of nominees
- Selection of Winner
- Response of Winner

Roles:
 - Host
 - Categories (and presenters in each category)
 - Nominees in each category (and who people are rooting for)
 - Winners in each category (and winner reactions)
 
 - Categories
 - Actors, Producers, Directors, Writers, etc.
 - Movies

 ^ Look for any semantic relations (i.e., you must be nominated to win, one winner for each category, one or two hosts / presenters per category)
